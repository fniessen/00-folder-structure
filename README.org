*Johnny Decimal System*

Integration with Other Tools -- The JDS emphasizes that folders are not the sole
organizing mechanism; applications like Bear or Things can serve as indexes for
managing tasks without needing physical folders:
- Use Bear for overarching notes that summarize projects or categories.
- Use Things for detailed task management without cluttering the folder structure.


In a typical JDS setup, the personal area can be categorized into several
subcategories, each assigned a unique decimal ID.


Things to find:
    Personal finances, investments
    Personal projects, home improvements
    Family documents plans
    Medical records, diet information
    Hobby-related files, personal interests
