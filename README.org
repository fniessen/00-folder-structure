* Index

*Johnny Decimal System*

Integration with Other Tools -- The JDS emphasizes that folders are not the sole
organizing mechanism; applications like Bear or Things can serve as indexes for
managing tasks without needing physical folders:
- Use Bear for overarching notes that summarize projects or categories.
- Use Things for detailed task management without cluttering the folder structure.


In a typical JDS setup, the personal area can be categorized into several
subcategories, each assigned a unique decimal ID.


Things to find:
    Personal finances, investments
    Personal projects, home improvements
    Family documents plans
    Medical records, diet information
    Hobby-related files, personal interests
    Personal learning, courses, certifications not related to work
    Travel plans, vacation ideas, leisure activities
    House documents, utilities, maintenance schedules
    Work-related administrative tasks, policies, procedures
    Work projects, client projects
    Work-related financial documents, expense reports, budgets
    HR-related documents, benefits information
    Marketing materials, sales reports, client information
    Work-related learning, professional development, training materials
    Operational documents, processes, workflows
    Work-related tech documentation, software licenses
