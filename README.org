*Johnny Decimal System*

Integration with Other Tools -- The JDS emphasizes that folders are not the sole
organizing mechanism; applications like Bear or Things can serve as indexes for
managing tasks without needing physical folders:
- Use Bear for overarching notes that summarize projects or categories.
- Use Things for detailed task management without cluttering the folder structure.


In a typical JDS setup, the personal area can be categorized into several
subcategories, each assigned a unique decimal ID.

Some common conventions and best practices for folder naming in structures across operating systems that keep file and folder organization consistent and efficient:

The CamelCase convention capitalizes the first letter of each word in a folder or file name without spaces. For example: MyDocuments, ProjectFiles.
The snake_case convention uses lowercase letters and underscores (_) to separate words in folder or file names. For example: user_profile, product_catalog.
Similar to snake_case, kebab-case separates words with hyphens (-) instead of underscores. For example: user-profile, product-catalog.
The dot.notation separates words in folder or file names with dots (.) and is commonly used in web development to name files and directories related to packages or namespaces. For example: com.example.app, my_project.utilities.
Prefixes or suffixes can indicate the type or purpose of a folder or file. For example: src for source code or docs for documentation.
Version numbers can clarify projects with multiple versions or releases, for example: v1.0, v2.0, release-3.0.
Date-based or chronological systems organize files or folders chronologically. For example: 2023-09-01 for September 1, 2023, or 2023-09 for the entire month of September 2023.

* First-level folder names in GitHub projects

By using these folder names, developers ensure their projects follow
a predictable and standardized structure, making it easier for contributors to
navigate and understand the project:

- ~src/~
  + Contains the main *source code of the project*.
- ~docs/~
  + Includes *project documentation* such as guides, API references, or README
    files.
- ~tests/~ (or ~test/~)
  + Contains unit, integration, and/or end-to-end *tests*.
- ~build/~ (or ~dist~)
  + Used for build outputs or *compiled* artifacts.
  + Often ignored in version control (e.g., via .gitignore) if it's generated
    during the build process.
- ~assets/~ (or ~public~)
  + Stores *images, styles, fonts*, or other non-code resources used in the
    project.
- ~config/~
  + Stores *configuration files*.
- ~lib/~
  + Stores reusable libraries, utility functions, or *third-party code*.
- ~scripts/~
  + Houses *utility scripts* for tasks like deployment, data migration, or *build
    processes*.
- ~tools/~?

Some projects also include:

- ~bin/~
  + Holds *executable scripts* or *binary files*.
  + Often used for CLI tools or startup scripts.
- ~examples/~
  + Provides *sample code* or *usage examples*.
- ~env/~
  + Stores *environment-related files*, such as configuration files for different
    deployment environments (development, staging, production).
  + Often excluded from version control.
- ~data/~
  + Used for *datasets* or *input files* required by the application.
- ~logs/~
  + Holds *log files generated by the application* during its execution.
  + Often excluded from version control.
